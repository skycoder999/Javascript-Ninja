/**
 * JS Challenge 2 - Pokemon!
 * -------------------------------------
 * Create a constructor function: Pokemon
 * It should have three instance properties
 * - name: string (ex. "Pikachu")
 * - type: string (ex. "Electric")
 * - attackList: array of string (ex. ["Tail Whip", "ThunderBolt", "Agility"])
 * It should also have two methods:
 * - callPokemon(): (output: I choose you, {Name}!)
 * - attack(number): (output: {Name}, use {Attack Name}.)
 * 
 * Then, create few Pokemons and test the functionality.
